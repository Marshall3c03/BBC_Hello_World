            Animals in space originally served to test the survivability of
            spaceflight, before human spaceflights were attempted.
        </p>
        <p>
            A wide variety of animals have been launched into space,
            including monkeys and apes, dogs, cats, tortoises, mice,
            rats, rabbits, birds, frogs, and insects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Two tortoises and a variety of insects were the first inhabitants of Earth to
            circle the Moon.
